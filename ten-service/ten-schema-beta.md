# ðŸš§ TEN schema(beta)

## Overview

TEN Schema provides a way to describe the data structure of TEN Value. TEN Value is a structured data type used in TEN Runtime to store information such as properties. TEN Schema can be used to define the data structure of configuration files for Extensions, as well as the data structure of messages sent and received by Extensions.

The most common use case is when there are two Extensions - A and B, and A sends a command to B. In this scenario, TEN Schema is involved in the following places:

* Configuration file of Extension A.
* Configuration file of Extension B.
* Data structure of the message carried by the command sent by A as a producer.
* Data structure of the message carried by the command received by B as a consumer.

### Configuration Files

RTE Extensions typically have two configuration files:

`property.json`: This file contains the business-specific configuration of the Extension, such as:

{% code title="property.josn" %}
```json
{
  "app_id": "123456",
  "channel": "test",
  "log": {
    "level": 1,
    "redirect_stdout": true,
    "file": "api.log"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

`manifest.json`: This file contains the immutable information of the Extension, including metadata (type, name, version, etc.) and schema definitions. For example:

{% code title="manifest.json" %}
```json
{
  "type": "extension",
  "name": "A",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "language": "cpp",
  "dependencies": [],
  "api": {}
}
```
{% endcode %}

Developers can customize the logic for loading configuration files in the Extension `on_init()` function. By default, TEN Extension automatically loads the `property.json` and `manifest.json` files in the directory. After the Extension`:on_start()` callback is triggered, developers can use rte:`get_property()` to retrieve the contents of `property.json`. For example:

````cpp
```
void on_init(rte::rte_t &rte, rte::metadata_info_t &manifest,
       rte::metadata_info_t &property) override {
  // You can load custom configuration files using the following method. In this case, the default property.json will not be loaded.
  // property.set(RTE_METADATA_JSON_FILENAME, "a.json");

  rte.on_init_done(manifest, property);
}
````

After the `rte.on_init_done()` is triggered, the content of property.json will be stored in TEN Runtime as an TEN Value, with the type of Object. Here are some details:

* `app_id` is a Value of type String, and developers can retrieve it using `rte.get_property_string("app_id")`, specifying the type as string.
* `log` is a Value of type Object. In the TEN Value system, Object is a composite structured data that contains other TEN Values in key-value pairs. For example, `level` is a field in `log` and its type is int64.



{% hint style="info" %}
Note

This involves one of the purposes of TEN Schema: to explicitly declare the precision of Values.

For JSON, an integer value like `1` is by default parsed as `int64` in x64. When TEN Runtime reads JSON, it can only handle it as `int64` by default. Even if the developer expects the type to be `uint8`, this information cannot be inferred from JSON alone. This is where TEN Schema comes in, to explicitly declare the type of `level` as `uint8`. After parsing property.json with TEN Runtime, the value of `level` will be evaluated based on the definition in the TEN Schema. If it meets the storage requirements of `uint8`, it will be stored as `uint8` in the TEN Value.

Note

One of the rules followed by TEN Schema is to ensure data integrity and no loss of precision during type conversion. It does not support cross-type re-parsing, such as converting int to double or string.
{% endhint %}



### TEN Schema

The type in TEN Schema is exactly the same as the type in TEN Value, including:

<table><thead><tr><th width="145">integer</th><th width="204">unsigned integer</th><th>float point</th><th>other</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>int8</code></td><td><code>uint8</code></td><td><code>float32</code></td><td><code>string</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>int16</code></td><td><code>uint16</code></td><td><code>float64</code></td><td><code>bool</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>int32</code></td><td><code>uint32</code></td><td></td><td><code>buf</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>int64</code></td><td><code>uint64</code></td><td></td><td><code>ptr</code></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><code>array</code></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><code>object</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



Except for the simple data types (array and object), the declaration is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "int8"
}
```

For the array type, the declaration is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "int8"
  }
}
```

For the object type, the declaration is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "field_1": {
      "type": "int8"
    },
    "field_2": {
      "type": "bool"
    }
  }
}
```

Using the example of property.json mentioned above, its corresponding TEN Schema is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "app_id": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "channel": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "log": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "level": {
          "type": "uint8"
        },
        "redirect_stdout": {
          "type": "bool"
        },
        "file": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note

* Currently, TEN Schema only supports the type keyword to meet the basic needs. It will be gradually improved based on future requirements.

### manifest.json

The definition of the TEN Schema for the Extension needs to be saved in the manifest.json file. Similar to property.json, after the rte.on\_init\_done() is executed, manifest.json will be parsed by the TEN Runtime. This allows the TEN Runtime to validate the data integrity based on the schema definitions when loading property.json.

The TEN Schema is placed under the api section in manifest.json. The api section is a JSON object that contains the definitions of all the schemas involved in the Extension, including the configurations mentioned above and the messages (TEN cmd/data/image\_frame/pcm\_frame) that will be introduced next. The structure of the api section is as follows:

{% code title="manifest.json" %}
```json
{
  "property": {},
  "cmd_in": [],
  "cmd_out": [],
  "data_in": [],
  "data_out": [],
  "image_frame_in": [],
  "image_frame_out": [],
  "pcm_frame_in": [],
  "pcm_frame_out": [],
  "interface_in": [],
  "interface_out": []
}
```
{% endcode %}

The schema for property.json is placed under the property section. The content of the manifest.json corresponding to the example mentioned above should be as follows:

{% code title="property.json" %}
```json
{
  "type": "extension",
  "name": "A",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "language": "cpp",
  "dependencies": [],
  "api": {
    "property": {
      "app_id": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "channel": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "log": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "level": {
            "type": "uint8"
          },
          "redirect_stdout": {
            "type": "bool"
          },
          "file": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Messages

Extensions can exchange messages, including cmd/data/image\_frame/pcm\_frame. If it is used as a producer (e.g., calling rte.send\_cmd()), the corresponding schema is defined in the xxx\_in section of manifest.json, such as cmd\_in. Similarly, if it is used as a consumer (e.g., receiving messages in the on\_cmd() callback), the corresponding schema is defined in the xxx\_out section of manifest.json, such as cmd\_out.

The schema definition for messages is indexed by name.

cmd must specify the name. For example:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "cmd_in": [
      {
        "name": "start",
        "property": {
          "app_id": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For data/image\_frame/pcm\_frame, the name is optional. This means that the name in the schema definition is optional; schemas without a specified name will be considered as the default schema. In other words, for any message, if a name exists, the schema will be indexed by that name; if not found, the default schema will be used. For example:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "data_in": [
      {
        "property": {
          "width": {
            "type": "uint32"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "speech",
        "property": {
          "width": {
            "type": "uint16"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Similarly, when using JSON as the property of a message, if a schema exists, the types and precision will be converted according to the definitions in the schema.

For the example mentioned above, Extension A's cmd\_out (i.e., A calling rte.send\_cmd()) corresponds to Extension B's cmd\_in (i.e., B receiving the message in the on\_cmd() callback).

Note

* Currently, if the cmd sent by A does not comply with the schema definition, B will not receive the cmd, and the TEN Runtime will return an error to A.

Compared to data/image\_frame/pcm\_frame, cmd has an ack (represented as status cmd in TEN). This means that when defining the cmd schema, you can also define the schema for the corresponding status cmd. For example:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "cmd_in": [
      {
        "name": "start",
        "property": {
          "app_id": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "result": {
          "property": {
            "detail": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "code": {
              "type": "uint8"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note

* "status" is the annotation key used to define the status schema.
* "rte/detail" is the annotation key used to define the type of detail in the status. It is used in APIs like rte.return\_string(), cmd.get\_detail(), etc.
* "status/property" is the annotation key that works the same as the property in cmd.
* The "status" in cmd\_in refers to the response received from the downstream Extension as a producer. Similarly, the "status" in cmd\_out refers to the response sent back to the upstream as a consumer.

### Example

Taking the rte\_stt\_asr\_filter extension as an example, let's see how to define the schema.

First, the property.json file under the rte\_stt\_asr\_filter extension is not used. Its configuration is specified in the Graph as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "extension",
  "name": "rte_stt_asr_filter",
  "addon": "rte_stt_asr_filter",
  "extension_group": "rtc_group",
  "property": {
    "app_id": "1a4dcbc3",
    "api_key": "b6e21445580c80a2a62a9c0394bc5e83",
    "api_secret": "ZTliNzFhODU2MDMzYzQzYzUxODNmY2Ix",
    "plugin_path": "addon/extension/rte_stt_asr_filter/lib/liblinux_audio_hy_extension.so",
    "data_encoding": "raw"
  }
}
```

The corresponding schema should be:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "property": {
      "app_id": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "api_key": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "api_secret": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "plugin_path": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "data_encoding": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, it will receive the following five cmds:

```cpp
if (command == COMMAND_START) {
  handleStart(rte, std::move(cmd));
} else if (command == COMMAND_STOP) {
  handleStop(rte, std::move(cmd));
} else if (command == COMMAND_ON_USER_AUDIO_TRACK_SUBSCRIBED) {
  handleUserAudioTrackSubscribed(rte, std::move(cmd));
} else if (command == COMMAND_ON_USER_AUDIO_TRACK_STATE_CHANGED) {
  handleUserAudioTrackStateChanged(rte, std::move(cmd));
} else if (command == COMMAND_QUERY) {
  handleQuery(rte, std::move(cmd));
} else {
  RTE_LOGE("FATAL: unknown command: %s", command.c_str());
  rte.return_string(RTE_STATUS_CODE_ERROR, "not implemented", std::move(cmd));
}
```

Let's take start and onUserAudioTrackSubscribed cmds as examples.

start

```cpp
class Config
{
  // ...

  private:
    std::vector<std::string> languages_;
    std::string licenseFilePath_;
};

void from_json(const nlohmann::json& j, Config& p)
{
  try {
    j.at("languages").get_to(p.languages_);
  } catch (std::exception& e) {
    RTE_LOGW("Failed to parse 'languages' property: %s", e.what());
  }

  try {
    j.at("licenseFilePath").get_to(p.licenseFilePath_);
  } catch (std::exception& e) {
    RTE_LOGW("Failed to parse 'licenseFilePath' property: %s", e.what());
  }
}
```

For the start cmd, it includes two properties:

* `languages`: an array type with elements of string type.
* `licenseFilePath`: a string type.

So, the corresponding schema should be:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "cmd_in": [
      {
        "name": "start",
        "property": {
          "languages": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "licenseFilePath": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "result": {
          "property": {
            "detail": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

onUserAudioTrackSubscribed

```cpp
void rte_stt_asr_filter_extension_t::handleUserAudioTrackSubscribed(
    rte::rte_t &rte, std::unique_ptr<rte::cmd_t> cmd) {
  auto user_id = cmd->get_property_string("userId");
  auto *track =
      cmd->get_property<agora::rtc::IRemoteAudioTrack *>("audioTrack");

  // ...

  rte.return_string(RTE_STATUS_CODE_OK, "done", std::move(cmd));
}
```

For the onUserAudioTrackSubscribed cmd, it includes two properties:

* `userId`: a string type.
* `audioTrack`: a ptr type pointing to agora::rtc::IRemoteAudioTrack.

So, the corresponding schema should be:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "cmd_in": [
      {
        "name": "onUserAudioTrackSubscribed",
        "property": {
          "userId": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "audioTrack": {
            "type": "ptr"
          }
        },
        "result": {
          "property": {
            "detail": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
